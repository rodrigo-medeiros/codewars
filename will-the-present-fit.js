// Santa's elves are boxing presents, and they need your help!
// Write a function that takes two arrays of dimensions of the present and the box, respectively,
// and returns a Boolean based on whether or not the present will fit in the box provided.
// The box's walls are one unit thick, so be sure to take that in to account.

// Example:

// willFit([10,7,16], [13, 32,10]);  //Returns true, box is bigger than present
// willFit([5, 7, 9], [9, 5, 7]);    //Returns false, present and box are same size
// willFit([17, 22, 10],[5, 5, 10]); //Returns false, box is too small

function willFit (present, box) {
  box = box.sort(function (a, b) {
    return a - b;
  });
  return present.sort(function (a, b) {
    return a - b;
  }).every(function (side) {
    return side < box.shift() - 1;
  });
